# output_information_users
This program reads a .csv file that the user enters. The user needs to insert the name of the csv file, along with the extension .csv, then insert the current path of the csv file, and finally the path in her/his computer that user would like to copy this file to.

The program then opens the file from the new location and inserts inti a dictionary the information in the form of key-value pairs.

Finally, the program prints information from the first 2 columns of the created dictionary. Using an object, the program prints the first character from each word inside the first column of the file. Then, using the same object, the program prints the first 3 characters in the string of the second column.
